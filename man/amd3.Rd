Ten Year Survival Trends of Neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration
at First Presentation
}
\section{Central retinal thickness (CRT)}{

There are double CRT measurements for 1011 time points. This is because the
data set curator provided both automatic measurement and manual measurement.
Unfortunately, based on the information in the raw data, it is not possible
to know which entry belongs to which. One possible way to adjust for this may
be to create an average for both measurements. For one way to do this, see
"Examples"
}

\section{Missing values}{

There are 1388 missing visual acuity entries and 858 missing central retinal
thickness entries.
}

\section{Study setting and design}{

Retrospective cohort study of treatment-naÃ¯ve, first-affected eyes with
nAMD started on ranibizumab before January 1, 2009.
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031). The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki
}

\section{Data source}{

All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an
electronic medical record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK).
Information governance authorised Moorfields Eye Clinic 19/07/2018.
Age not provided as a continuous variable as in original analysis
to facilitate de-identification
